# YOLO Algorithm

### Overview
- **Algorithm**: You Only Look Once (YOLO)
- **Type**: Real-time object detection
- **Key Feature**: Single-pass processing of entire image
- **Output**: Simultaneous object classification and localization

### Core Innovations
- Introduced unified detection framework (2015)
- Implemented grid-based prediction system
- Combined classification and regression in single network


## Applications  
YOLO is widely used in various fields that require real-time object detection, such as:
- Surveillance systems.  
- Autonomous vehicles.  
- Augmented reality mobile applications.  
- Robotics and automation.  
- Real-time object recognition in smart cameras.  


### Key Advantages
- Real-time processing capability.  
- Balanced speed/accuracy tradeoff.  
- Simple end-to-end training.  
- Adaptable to mobile devices.
